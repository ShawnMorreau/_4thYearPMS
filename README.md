# _4thYearPMS
Sprint 1:
The project we are building is a web app for a fourth year project management system that will allow project coordinators to create deadlines and manage events. Professors will be able to create/supervise projects and allow students to join their project. Students will be able to view projects, register for projects, and view upcoming events.

The first feature to be developed will be a table in which posts all projects that it gathers from a database.
